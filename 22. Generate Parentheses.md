#### Brute Force 
In this case brute force is the optimal approach . 

- We have to use a backtracking approach to generate every possible combination . Therefore at step we bifurcate to `s+"(" and s+")"` 
- Everytime we reach the max length of characters . We use the regular stack approach to check if the string is valid . If it is , we add them to the list of answers and return them .

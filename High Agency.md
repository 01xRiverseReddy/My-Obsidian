High Agency in the simplest terms is one’s ability to solve problems . As the example goes ,”If you were trapped in a jail in a 3rd world country , who would you call “ . The goal is to be the person people call you when they are stuck in a 3rd world country’s jail . 

The blog suggests that there are a few ways to identify High Agency people such 

- Immigrant mentality 
- Treadmill energy 
- They don’t trust they verify 
- Self-taught learning machines 
- Questioning the question 
- Quit something prestige 

There are some wired shit that the blog suggests but I feel there’s ambiguity like Wierd Teenage Hobbies , sending you niche content Mean to your face , nice behind your back . 


The three key attributes are
- Disagreeability - Which I have in plenty 
- Clear thinking - Which I feel I lack completely 
- Bias to Action - Which I am developing recently 


### High Agency software 

High Agency Software are few on they key underlying traits that high agents live by . Shockingly enough some of which I already live by such as “Now Moment” for whatever fucked up reasons it’s embedded into my mind . There’s no normal was figured out through Robert green’s Laws of human nature . There are no Adults , is also something I already live by because I idolise no one and I believe in myself for being the best there is .  But the wierd and interesting case studies that were discussed is a pretty good example. The two things that caught my mind were 

- There is no way - I always believed that there is always a clear cut path to follow for achieving some things but this blog’s example would suggest otherwise 
- There is no unsolvable problem - Anything that does not defy the laws of physics is just begging to be solved out there . The hacking of the roulette is a pretty good example . 


### Escaping Low agency 

- Vague Trap in some sense loosely translates to not having clear line of thought on something . This is something I fortunately don’t fall in to as I have figured this quite a while back . 
- The midwit trap is interesting because I feel like this is exactly where I have . The midwit dude is the one who overcomplicates things to gaurantee himself into success . 
- Attachment trap is something that I occassionally fall into with the temptation of doing things better . 
- Rumination trap is one of the things I am slowly tapping out of . It is basically overthinking and the key different between midwit and rumination trap is the in the midwit trap the person actually does all the overthought stuff wasting energy and time . Rumination on the other hand is just overthinking and stopping at one place . 
- Overwhelm trap is something that I have finally tapped out of and it is the very thing that has held me back my entire life . People always telling me that I am not good enough for complicated stuff and I should settle for easy and simpler things in life . 


### Turning bullshit into reality 

- Create a flow chart , have to try sounds effective to piece things and putting them into motion . 
- Collect smart minds and have them piece together solutions . 
- Story razor sounds stupid , picking the option that results in a better product of fame . 
- Asking for help is good . Projecting possible responses is from mentors is kind of a good alternative but not an absolute solution imo .

### Intro 
- Graph is a data structure where two data point have some form connection and are linked together to from an Edge . 
- Vertices are the data points when connected that form an edge . 
- An Edge on the Graph can have a direction or it can be bi-directional . Directions are used to establish a more meaningful relationship between two vertices . 
- Each edge in a graph can have a weight associated with it just to add some form of information/ cost to signify a relationship between two vertices. 




### Representation 
Graph representation is basically the ways in which a graph can be stored in a program so that we can work on it . There are only 3 main forms of representation -

1. [[Adjacency Matrix]]
2. [[Adjacency List]]
3. [[Edge List]]


### Algorithms 

Graphs have various algorithms in place for different purposes . 

- **Traversal algorithms** are used to travel through the graph , visit every vertex of the graph 
	- [[Depth-First Search]]
	- [[Breadth-First Search]]

- The law of irrationality says that it is impossible to completely embrace the rational side of human beings because through millions of years human beings evolved in ways only to survive and adapt to circumstances and now due to the rapid changes in human civilisation  , evolution has not caught up . 
- Human brain has three portions , the reptilian part which is instinctive and primariliy is the source of instincts such as  envy , greed  etc . The emotional region is the mammalian part rather which triggers joy , anger , frustration , and the other one is to communicate i.e language driven.  So it is hard for people to completely translate emotions and instincts to human language because they are generated on different regions of the brain . 
- **Recognize the biases** - This the first step to making more rational decisions . The pleasure principle says that a human being is always compelled by the desire for pleasure and the avoidance of pain therefore by the nature itself he resorts to drawing conclusions that sooth his ego and personality . This pleasure principle itself recognizes in all the biases trying to smooth our egos and satisfy our conclusions . 
- Confirmation bias (assuming that you derive logical conclusions ) , group bias ( believing that you are sigma and your opinions are authentic ) , conviction bias (salesman bias is what I would like to call it but you can decide at something )
- **Recognising inflaming factors** - This is obvious , having moments of extreme joy or sadness is one of them , the most common out of all of them is having a triggering point from childhood . Bottom line

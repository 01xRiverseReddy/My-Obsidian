Incline Dumbbell chest press uses an inclined bench at 30 degrees with an arched back . Always hold the dumbbells in parallel to your nipple line . When you dumbbells are perfectly in line with the nipples , lower your dumbbells even further to increase the chest stretch .  Hold the stretch for 2 second before sending the dumbbells up for maximum stretch .

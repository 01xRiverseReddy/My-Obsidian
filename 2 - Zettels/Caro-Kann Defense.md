### Opening move 
As the name indicates this opening is for weight and it is a response to the counter move of the king’s pawn e4 to which black responds with c3 attempting to use it as a flank pawn and remove a central pawn of the opponent . 


### Common Variation

The most common variation is that white counter with the idea of developing its central pawn d4 and black counters with d5 tempting the pawn e4 to capture .After captures , We proceed with regular development and try to get our rook in to the open C file trying to activate the rook’s laser beam . Not developing the E pawn to E6 is key or else you will be ruining the position . 


### Advance Pawn Variation 

In the advance pawn variation white pushed the E5 pawn ahead to the E6 square grabbing space as well as staying safe . The response to this variation would be to advance the C7->C6 . D5 pawn capturing C6 is more advance , the common response would be to protect the pawn chain using C3 . In this scenario developing the bishop to F5 is a blunder as H4 will eventually trap the bishop instead . We wait for the opponent to develop knight F3 so that we can hold the Queen pin with our light squared bishop . If the bishop is threatened we instantly take and develop our queen to B6 square targeting the D4 pawn and B2 pawn (if white defends D4 with Bishop ).

### Knight Defending variation

This is variation is when white defends using the C3 square and the only option for black is to take the E4 pawn using the D5 pawn . Else any other moves will result in a space constricting problem . After pawn takes , knight takes and the best option is to develop our king side knight to f7 . If white knight take we have an overly defended king side position . We then proceed to do the regular development of our pieces and position the rook on E file which is open , after king side castling .

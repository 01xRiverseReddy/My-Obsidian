### Background 
The most basic data structure is used for storing contiguous elements .  The are more flexible when their memory allocation is dynamic , which is why we have dynamic array aka , vectors  . 
Hashing is a much more frequent technique used to store frequencies or have one-to-one 
(Key,value) pairing for fast accessing . 

### Use cases 

- ASCII  map  . The array can used as a hashmap when we have our input constrained to ascii characters . 
- Can be used to store visited elements in a graph as well as adjacency lists . 
- Hashing can be even used to have addresses as keys .

	- Salt
	- Potassium Chloride
	- Magnesium malate
	- Stevia(flavour)


- #### Formulated LMNT
	- Salt 
	- Potassium Citrate 
	- Magnesium Malate



### Procedure  for one serving 

- Take salt , preferably sea salt , add proportion in such a way the the level of sodium is 1200g which is recommended as the optimal range . Half a teaspoon is usually 2.84 grams that is for the sodium we need . I SAY 3 GRAMS OF SALT IS THE MOST ACCURATE MEASUREMENT 
- Potassium citrate is a pretty simple measurement 500mg of it equals 200mg of potassium . 
- Magnesium Malate is exactly 1/4 teaspoon which can be impossible to measure . Roughly based upon my calculation (1500mg of magnesium malate  = 225 mg of magnesium ) to achieve 60 mg which is recommended we would need 700 mg of magnesium malate .

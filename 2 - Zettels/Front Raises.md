Front Raises involve a straight back standing position and a weight in the hand / both hands . This could usually be barbell or cable . This targets the anterior  region of the  muscle or the front part .  The best way I would think of is to use rowing bar and then position the cable at the bottom and then have the movement from bottom to up.

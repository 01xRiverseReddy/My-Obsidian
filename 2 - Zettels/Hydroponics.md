### Intro 

Hydroponics a technique of farming that fall under the urban farming domain . The key thing about hydroponics is that the element of soil is completely absent and is replaces with a regular supply of water . Hydroponics replaces soil with water and aims to achieve higher yields and faster yield . The key benefit of hydroponics is since soil is absent we do not have to worry about fertilisers or soil related diseases coming into the picture . 


### Types

#### Wick System 

- It is the simplest system , it just involves connecting the roots to the water(nutrient solution ) to using a rope  , felt or some form of connection . 
- The reason this is so simple is because it does not need electricity or pumps to make the nutrients reach the water . 
- Nutrient delivery is slow and not suitable for fruits or bigger plants . 


#### Deep Water Culture 

- Plants roots are submerged in continuously in water where there is a nutrient rich solution .
- The key thing here is that there needs to be an air pump to provide oxygen to the root or else it would result in rotting . 
- Key thing here is the air pump fails then the roots can suffocate quickly  and the temperature has to be regulated or it will result in the growth of algae . 
- An air stone is needed in this set-up where an air pump sends oxygen to the plants submerged in water . 


#### Nutrient Film Technique 

- Nutrient film technique is the evolved form of DWC where the nutrient solution is supplied to the roots using PVC pipes that are slightly tilted so that the roots can get oxygen at the same time . 
- In this technique the water must always keep flowing or else it might result in the death of the plant 


### Ebb and Flow technique 

- Plants sit in a growing tray and get periodically pumped with nutrient solution and emptied . 
- This looks kind of similar to nutrient film technique except the water is drained out periodically . Which is what I donâ€™t get . In the NFT technique it was stated that continuous supply of water was needed . But this technique contradicts that where nutrient solution has to be periodically deployed . 
- This method also requires a pump like the NFT to periodically deploy water . 


#### Drip System 

- This is used more on Controlled Environment Agriculture where the investment is high enough . 
- Drip systems can be expensive initially but the maintenance is relatively quite small . 
- This can be used for large scale farming where the ground to cover is much more huge than conventional urban setups .

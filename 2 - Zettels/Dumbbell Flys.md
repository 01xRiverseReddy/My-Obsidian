Dumbbell flys involve laying on a flat bench with an arched lower back and performing the fly movement . When holding the dumbbells perpendicularly upwards , lower your shoulder blades towards the back for more chest activation . The arms do not need to be straight , they have to be at a 15 degree tilt for better motion .  Always remember to pause for two seconds at the extreme position to yield maximum muscle growth .

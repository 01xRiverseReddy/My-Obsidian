### Guard Rails 
- Always stand one racket way from the outside outer/inner line (depending on double or singles ) . Stay one racket away from the box line at all times . 
- When tired , give up on smashes and drops and regain energy for one finisher streak to get the point . 
- When the lead is huge break the flow of the game for a minute or two because you always get over confident . 


### Edges 
- Attacking is my game , always start with it . 
- Smashes are my winning point , they have the greatest probability of winning my point . Hit to miss ratio is very high . 
- Movement and speed is very high hence always try for the impossible . 
- Eye lock on the shuttle works very well .


### Fundamental Truths 
- You cannot win every single point or take into account for your partners mistakes . 
- You may loose a streak of points at some point and you should keep your shit together . 
- Your mental state might not be on the same page as your attacking style so move defensive and play corner shots and drops . Move to smashes only when the smash is guaranteed .

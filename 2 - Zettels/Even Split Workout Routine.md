This workout routine is directly going back to the roots , which basically targets each major muscle group everyday . This basically comes with the anatomy of the below structure - 
- **Day 1**: Chest
- **Day 2**: Back
- **Day 3**: Shoulders
- **Day 4**: Arms
- **Day 5**: Legs
- Rest

The goal of this workout routine is to flip it to an intermediate level to an advanced level . This to continuously engage the muscle in a state of hypertrophy . For example if you hit chest on Monday , you want to hit them again on Thursday so that the muscles have already been through recovery phase (48-72 hours). 
The important step is to not spend too much time the second hit of the muscles , so that you can focus on the first hit of those muscles that day . For example on Thursday if you are hitting Arms , you would want hit chest for Less time and hit Arms for most of the Time . 
To hit two birds with one stone  - we can target progressive overload in the second hit and minimise the reps to save time . 

Progressive Overload would have 3-6 reps , where as the regular load would have only 8-12 reps . 

This is how the custom routine would look .

Day 1 - Since I would be working from Home Day 1 would have bodyweight arm exercises at home .

Day 2 - I would also be working from home on this day so I would be doing all bodyweight leg exercise variations on this day at home . 

Day 3 : This day can be ignored . Can leave it for future planning . 

Day 4 : This day is crucial , since I would be at office most of the time . I would need to Hit Chest before leaving and also after coming form office . 

Day 5 : Figuring it out 

Day 6 : Ignore 

Day 7 : Holiday , easy to do all the shoulder bodyweight exercises at home .

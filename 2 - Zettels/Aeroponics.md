### Intro 
Aeroponics is a subset of hydroponics but the nutrient delivery system is little different and the layout of the crops is different . Aeroponics translated to its actual meaning is growing plants in thin air . The crops in Aeroponics are structures in towers where each crop has a spot on the tower . Unlike hydroponics the towers do not have an active supply of water , they instead a have their dangling roots supplied with nutrient dense mist from misting chambers . 



### Structure 

- Each aeroponics tower can be of two to 3 meters tall at most and can be two to three feet in diameter .
- Each aeroponic tower has a specific number of sockets and in which you place the plants .
- The water is stored in a chamber at bottom of the last row in the aeroponic tower and is then sprinkled to the plants using a donut like structure on the top of the last row the aeroponic tower . 
- The material of the aeroponic tower is mostly made out of plastic . 
- The sees initially need a medium to be placed into hence coco coir , Rockwool or other substances are used simultaneously .


### The key Takeaways

- The need for pesticides and herbicides are completely eliminated due to the absence of soil . 
- Nutrient is completely managed by the nutrient solution aka the water supplied to the plants . 
- Controlled environment agriculture is key proponent to increase the range of crops that can be grown .

Plan : 12 weeks 
2 Phases


## **Phase 1: Build a Strong Foundation**

### **1. Understand the Basics**

- [ ] **Learn Core Concepts**:
    - [ ] Load Balancing
    - [ ] Caching
    - [ ] Data Partitioning (Sharding)
    - [ ] Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance (CAP Theorem)
    - [ ] Distributed Systems Basics
- [ ] **Recommended Resources**:
    - [ ] _Grokking the System Design Interview_ (Educative.io)
    - [ ] _Designing Data- [ ]Intensive Applications_ by Martin Kleppmann

### **2. Master Networking Essentials**

- [ ] Understand concepts like:
    - [ ] HTTP/HTTPS
    - [ ] DNS
    - [ ] TCP/IP, UDP
    - [ ] Firewalls, CDNs
- [ ] **Practice Tools**:
    - [ ] Wireshark or Postman for hands- [ ]on exploration.

### **3. Study Databases**

- [ ] Types of Databases:
    - [ ] SQL vs. NoSQL
    - [ ] Relational vs. Document- [ ]based, Key- [ ]Value, Columnar, Graph Databases
- [ ] Topics:
    - [ ] Indexing
    - [ ] ACID and BASE properties
    - [ ] Replication and Partitioning
- [ ] **Hands- [ ]On Practice**:
    - [ ] Set up a relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and a NoSQL database (MongoDB, Cassandra).

## **Phase 2: Develop System Design Knowledge**

### **4. Learn Common Patterns**

- [ ] Common Design Patterns:
    - [ ] Microservices
    - [ ] Event- [ ]Driven Architecture
    - [ ] Circuit Breaker
    - [ ] Retry Mechanisms
    - [ ] API Gateway
- [ ] Resources:
    - [ ] _System Design Primer_ on GitHub
    - [ ] _Clean Architecture_ by Robert C. Martin

### **5. Explore Distributed Systems**

- [ ] Concepts:
    - [ ] Distributed Consensus (Raft, Paxos)
    - [ ] Eventual Consistency
    - [ ] Leader Election
- [ ] Resources:
    - [ ] MIT's Distributed Systems course (online)

- [ ]- [ ]- [ ]

## **Phase 3: Learn and Practice Designing**

### **6. Study Real- [ ]world Systems**

- [ ] Analyze systems like:
    - [ ] URL Shorteners (e.g., Bitly)
    - [ ] Social Media (e.g., Instagram, Twitter)
    - [ ] Messaging Systems (e.g., WhatsApp, Slack)
    - [ ] File Storage Systems (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive)
- [ ] **Action**: Decompose these systems into components and identify trade- [ ]offs.

### **7. Build Small Projects**

- [ ] Create simplified versions of systems like:
    - [ ] A rate- [ ]limited API
    - [ ] A scalable search engine
    - [ ] A chat application using WebSockets
- [ ] Use cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) for deployment.

- [ ]- [ ]- [ ]

## **Phase 4: Master Problem- [ ]Solving for Interviews**

### **8. Practice Interview Problems**

- [ ] Focus on popular system design questions:
    - [ ] Design YouTube
    - [ ] Design a scalable logging system
    - [ ] Design a payment gateway
- [ ] Platforms:
    - [ ] Mock interviews on Pramp
    - [ ] Discussions on LeetCode or Glassdoor

### **9. Mock Interviews**

- [ ] Conduct mock interviews with peers or mentors to simulate real interview scenarios.
- [ ] Focus on:
    - [ ] Clarifying requirements
    - [ ] Trade- [ ]off analysis
    - [ ] Scalability and reliability

- [ ]- [ ]- [ ]

## **Phase 5: Stay Updated**

### **10. Learn Industry Trends**

- [ ] Topics:
    - [ ] Serverless Architecture
    - [ ] Edge Computing
    - [ ] Emerging Database Technologies (e.g., NewSQL)
- [ ] Subscribe to:
    - [ ] _InfoQ_ for system architecture trends
    - [ ] _High Scalability_ blog

### **11. Contribute and Collaborate**

- [ ] Contribute to open- [ ]source distributed system projects.
- [ ] Participate in system design discussions on platforms like GitHub or Reddit.

- [ ]- [ ]- [ ]

### **Tools and Practices Throughout**

- [ ] **Tools to Learn**:
    - [ ] Kubernetes, Docker
    - [ ] Prometheus, Grafana for monitoring
    - [ ] Kafka, RabbitMQ for messaging
- [ ] **Document Your Learning**:
    - [ ] Create design diagrams (e.g., with Draw.io or Lucidchart)
    - [ ] Write detailed case studies of systems you design.

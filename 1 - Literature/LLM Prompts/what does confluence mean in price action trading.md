In price action trading, _confluence_ refers to the alignment of multiple factors or signals in the market that reinforce a potential trade setup. Traders look for confluence to increase the probability of success for a trade by combining different elements or indicators that all suggest the same market direction. Confluence generally increases confidence in a trade since it indicates a stronger likelihood that price will move in the anticipated direction.

Common elements of confluence in price action trading include:

1. **Support and Resistance Levels**: Price areas where reversals or significant movements frequently occur.
2. **Trendlines**: Key levels that show the overall direction of the market; if price action coincides with a trendline, it may strengthen the setup.
3. **Candlestick Patterns**: Specific formations (like pin bars, engulfing patterns) that signal potential reversals or continuations.
4. **Moving Averages**: Dynamic support or resistance; if price interacts with a moving average at a key level, it can act as confluence.
5. **Fibonacci Levels**: Retracement levels (e.g., 38.2%, 61.8%) where price tends to react, especially when they overlap with other signals.
6. **Volume**: High trading volume at certain levels can confirm the strength of a price movement or level.

When multiple of these factors align, traders see it as a stronger signal to enter a trade, as each element supports the validity of the setup.

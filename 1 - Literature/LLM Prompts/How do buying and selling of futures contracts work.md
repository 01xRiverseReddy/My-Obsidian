Buying and selling futures contracts are somewhat different from trading stocks, as they involve agreements to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future date, rather than taking immediate ownership of that asset. Here's a step-by-step guide on how it works:

### 1. **Opening a Position: Buying or Selling a Futures Contract**

- **Buying (Long Position)**: If you buy a futures contract, you’re agreeing to purchase the underlying asset at the contract’s price upon expiration. You are taking a "long" position, which means you profit if the asset’s price rises above the contract price by the expiration date.
- **Selling (Short Position)**: If you sell a futures contract, you’re agreeing to sell the asset at the contract’s price upon expiration. You’re taking a "short" position, so you profit if the price falls below the contract price.

### 2. **Initial Margin and Maintenance Margin**

- Futures trading typically requires only a small percentage of the contract value upfront, called the _initial margin_. This is a "good faith" deposit with the broker or exchange.
- Throughout the life of the contract, if the market moves against your position, you may need to add funds to your account to maintain the position, called the _maintenance margin_.

### 3. **Marking to Market**

- Futures contracts are marked to market daily, meaning any gains or losses from price changes are calculated and reflected in the trader’s account balance at the end of each trading day. This ensures that traders are meeting margin requirements and that accounts stay current.

### 4. **Closing or Settling the Position**

- **Closing the Contract (Offset)**: Most futures traders don’t hold the contract until expiration. Instead, they close the contract early by taking an opposite position. For example, if you bought a contract (long), you’d close by selling a contract of the same type, and vice versa. The difference in price from when you opened the contract to when you closed it is your profit or loss.
- **Physical or Cash Settlement**: If the contract is held to expiration, there are two possible settlements:
    - _Physical Delivery_: Some contracts, like those for commodities, involve the actual delivery of the asset (e.g., barrels of oil). However, this is rare for individual investors.
    - _Cash Settlement_: Many contracts are cash-settled, meaning only the difference in price is paid, rather than delivering the physical asset.

### Example of Buying and Selling a Futures Contract

Let’s say you believe the price of gold, currently trading at $1,800 per ounce, will rise, so you buy a gold futures contract (going long) at $1,800, with each contract representing 100 ounces of gold.

- If the price rises to $1,850 per ounce, you could sell a futures contract to close your position. You’d make a profit of $50 per ounce, or $5,000 total (100 ounces x $50).
- Conversely, if the price drops to $1,750 per ounce, you could close your position by selling, but you’d incur a loss of $50 per ounce, or $5,000 total.

### The Role of Leverage

Since futures require only a small initial margin, they allow for leveraged trading. With leverage, you can control large amounts of an asset with a relatively small investment, magnifying both potential gains and potential losses.

### Risks and Rewards

While futures offer significant opportunities, they also carry high risks due to leverage and price volatility. This makes futures suitable for both hedgers (looking to manage price risks) and speculators (looking to profit from price movements).

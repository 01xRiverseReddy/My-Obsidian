Apex is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language developed by Salesforce. It is syntactically similar to Java and is used to execute business logic on the Salesforce platform.

  

How Apex is Used in Salesforce

  

Apex is mainly used for:

1. Triggers – Automating actions (e.g., updating records, sending emails) when certain events occur in Salesforce (like insert, update, delete).

2. Classes & Methods – Defining custom business logic and reusable functions.

3. Batch Processing – Handling large volumes of data asynchronously.

4. Scheduled Jobs – Running tasks at specified times using Apex Scheduler.

5. Web Services & API Integrations – Creating REST/SOAP web services for external integrations.

6. Asynchronous Processing – Using Future Methods, Queueable Apex, and Batch Apex for background processing.

Apex has several unique features that make it well-suited for developing applications on the Salesforce platform. Here are some special aspects of Apex:

1. Cloud-Native & Multi-Tenant Execution

• Apex runs entirely on the Salesforce cloud, meaning there’s no need for separate hosting or infrastructure.

• It operates in a multi-tenant environment, where multiple users share the same system resources.

• Salesforce enforces governor limits to prevent a single user from monopolizing system resources.

1. Governor Limits for Scalability & Performance

  

Since Apex runs in a shared environment, Salesforce imposes limits on resource consumption to ensure fair usage:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Limit|Description|
|SOQL Queries|Max 100 queries per transaction|
|DML Statements|Max 150 DML operations per transaction|
|Heap Size|Max 6MB for synchronous and 12MB for async|
|CPU Time|Max 10,000ms per transaction|
|Records Retrieved|Max 50,000 records via SOQL|
|Future Calls|Max 50 per transaction|

Why it matters?

Developers must write optimized and bulk-friendly code to avoid exceeding limits.

1. Database Integration (SOQL & DML)

• Apex is tightly integrated with Salesforce’s database (SObjects), making it easy to query and manipulate records.

• It supports SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language), similar to SQL, for fetching records.

• It also supports DML (Data Manipulation Language) for inserting, updating, and deleting records.

  

Example:

// SOQL Query

List<Account> accList = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Industry = 'Finance'];

  

// DML Operation

Account acc = new Account(Name = 'New Company');

insert acc;

1. Built-in Asynchronous Processing

  

Apex provides multiple ways to run tasks asynchronously (in the background):

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Feature|Use Case|
|@future Method|Quick async operations like API calls|
|Batch Apex|Processing large datasets in batches|
|Queueable Apex|Chaining jobs for complex processes|
|Scheduled Apex|Running jobs at scheduled intervals|

Example: Future Method

public class AsyncExample {

    @future

    public static void runAsyncTask() {

        System.debug('Executed in Background');

    }

}

1. Event-Driven with Apex Triggers

• Apex supports Triggers, which are event-driven scripts that execute before or after database operations.

• Triggers are useful for automating actions such as validation, updating related records, or logging changes.

  

Example: Before Insert Trigger

trigger AccountTrigger on Account (before insert) {

    for (Account acc : Trigger.new) {

        acc.Name = acc.Name + ' - Verified';

    }

}

1. Security & Sharing Rules

• Apex enforces user permissions, field-level security, and sharing rules automatically.

• Developers can use with sharing and without sharing keywords to control data access.

  

Example: Enforcing Sharing Rules

public with sharing class AccountManager {

    public List<Account> getAccounts() {

        return [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account];

    }

}

1. Supports Custom APIs (REST & SOAP)

• Apex can create RESTful web services to expose Salesforce data to external systems.

• It can also consume external APIs using HTTP Callouts.

  

Example: Creating a REST API

@RestResource(urlMapping='/customApi/*')

global with sharing class CustomApi {

    @HttpGet

    global static String fetchData() {

        return 'Hello from Salesforce API';

    }

}

1. Integration with Lightning Components & Flows

• Apex is commonly used in Lightning Web Components (LWC) to fetch and process data.

• It also powers Salesforce Flows by providing backend logic.

  

Example: Apex Method for LWC

public with sharing class AccountService {

    @AuraEnabled

    public static List<Account> getAccounts() {

        return [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account LIMIT 10];

    }

}

1. Supports Test-Driven Development (TDD)

• Apex has a built-in unit testing framework.

• Code coverage of at least 75% is required before deploying Apex code to production.

• Tests are written using @isTest annotation.

  

Example: Test Class

@isTest

private class AccountTest {

    @isTest static void testAccountCreation() {

        Account acc = new Account(Name = 'Test Account');

        insert acc;

  

        Account fetchedAcc = [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name = 'Test Account' LIMIT 1];

        System.assertNotEquals(null, fetchedAcc);

    }

}

1. Built-in Exception Handling & Logging

• Apex provides a try-catch-finally structure for handling exceptions gracefully.

• Developers use System.debug() for logging and debugging in Salesforce logs.

  

Example: Exception Handling

try {

    Integer result = 5 / 0; // Causes exception

} catch (Exception e) {

    System.debug('Error: ' + e.getMessage());

}

1. Metadata & Dynamic Apex

• Apex allows dynamic SOQL queries and dynamic object manipulation.

• It can interact with Salesforce Metadata API to fetch object definitions.

  

Example: Dynamic SOQL Query

String objName = 'Account';

String query = 'SELECT Id, Name FROM ' + objName;

List<SObject> records = Database.query(query);

Conclusion

  

Apex is not just another programming language; it is specifically designed for Salesforce automation, integrations, and database interactions. Its key strengths include:

  

✅ Tightly integrated with Salesforce CRM

✅ Built-in security and data-sharing enforcement

✅ Asynchronous processing for scalability

✅ Event-driven architecture with triggers

✅ Cloud-based execution with governor limits

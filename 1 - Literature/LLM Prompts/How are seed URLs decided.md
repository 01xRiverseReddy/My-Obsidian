### Significance of Seed URLs in a Web Crawler

**Seed URLs** are the starting points from which a web crawler begins its exploration of the web. They are critically important because:

1. **Initialization Point**:
   - The crawler has to start somewhere, and seed URLs are that starting point.
   - They define the initial scope and direction of the crawl.

2. **Influence on Coverage**:
   - The choice of seed URLs can heavily influence which parts of the web are discovered and how quickly.
   - Good seeds improve the likelihood of finding relevant and high-quality content early.

3. **Efficiency and Priority**:
   - Well-chosen seeds can lead to faster discovery of useful or authoritative pages, optimizing bandwidth and storage.

4. **Domain Control and Focus**:
   - Seeds help control crawl boundaries. For example, for a domain-specific crawler, seeds may be URLs from that specific domain only.

### How Are Seed URLs Decided?

Seed URLs are selected based on the **purpose of the crawler**. Here are common strategies:

1. **Manual Selection**:
   - For focused or vertical crawlers (e.g., news, academic papers), URLs are handpicked by domain experts.
   - Example: For crawling academic papers, seed URLs might include `arxiv.org`, `ieee.org`, or `springer.com`.

2. **Popular or Authoritative Sites**:
   - Often start with high-authority domains like `wikipedia.org`, `nytimes.com`, `cnn.com` for general crawls.
   - These are likely to have high-quality content and good link structures.

3. **Search Engine Bootstrapping**:
   - Use a search engine to find pages related to a topic, and use those links as seeds.

4. **Historical Crawls / Previous Data**:
   - Use links from previous crawl logs or sitemaps as seeds for subsequent crawls.

5. **Domain Sitemaps**:
   - Publicly available sitemaps (`/sitemap.xml`) provide an excellent list of crawlable URLs for a given site.

6. **Trending or Social Media Links**:
   - For real-time or event-based crawling (e.g., news or social media), trending URLs from Twitter, Reddit, etc., may be used.

### Summary

| Aspect               | Seed URL Role |
|----------------------|---------------|
| **Starting Point**   | Defines where crawling begins. |
| **Scope Control**    | Limits or expands what the crawler will discover. |
| **Crawl Efficiency** | Leads to faster discovery of important pages. |
| **Customization**    | Allows tailoring based on domain, topic, or goals. |

Choosing the right seed URLs is both an art and a scienceâ€”balancing domain relevance, coverage, and crawl constraints.

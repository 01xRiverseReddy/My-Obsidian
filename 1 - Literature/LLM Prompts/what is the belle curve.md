The term you’re likely thinking of is the "bell curve." The bell curve is a graphical representation of a normal distribution, which is a common probability distribution in statistics. Its shape resembles a bell, with a peak in the middle and symmetric tails on either side. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Mean, Median, and Mode**: In a perfect bell curve, the mean, median, and mode are all located at the center of the distribution, representing the highest point of the curve.
    
2. **Symmetry**: The curve is symmetric around the mean, so the data on the left side of the mean is a mirror image of the data on the right.
    
3. **Standard Deviation**: This measures the spread of data points from the mean. In a normal distribution:
    
    - About 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.
    - About 95% falls within two standard deviations.
    - About 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.
4. **Applications**: The bell curve is used in a variety of fields, from grading in education (often referred to as "grading on a curve") to assessing IQ scores, performance metrics, and many natural phenomena.

A **normal distribution** is a statistical term describing a distribution of data that creates a symmetrical, bell-shaped curve. It’s one of the most important and commonly observed distributions in statistics. Here’s what defines it:

1. **Symmetry**: A normal distribution is symmetric around its mean. This symmetry means that data points are equally distributed on both sides of the mean, creating a mirror-image effect.
    
2. **Mean, Median, and Mode**: In a normal distribution, the mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most common value) are all located at the center of the distribution, which is the highest point on the bell curve.
    
3. **Standard Deviation**: The spread of the data in a normal distribution is measured by the standard deviation:
    
    - 68% of data falls within one standard deviation from the mean.
    - 95% falls within two standard deviations.
    - 99.7% falls within three standard deviations. This spread is called the **68-95-99.7 rule** or the **empirical rule**.
4. **Applications**: The normal distribution appears frequently in the natural and social sciences and in real-world data such as heights, test scores, and measurement errors. It’s often used in hypothesis testing, confidence interval calculations, and other statistical analyses because of its well-understood properties.
    

The normal distribution is foundational to many statistical methods and assumptions. If you visualize it, imagine a smooth, bell-shaped curve centered at the mean, with most of the data points concentrated around this center and fewer as you move further from it.

Here’s the bell curve in action! The graph shows a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The shaded areas represent different ranges:

- **±1 SD (Standard Deviation)**: About 68% of the data falls within this range.
- **±2 SD**: Roughly 95% of the data lies within this range.
- **±3 SD**: Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within this range.

This distribution is commonly seen in real-world data like test scores and measurement errors.

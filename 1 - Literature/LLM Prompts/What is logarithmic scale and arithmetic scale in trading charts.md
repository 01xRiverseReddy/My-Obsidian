In trading charts, logarithmic and arithmetic (or linear) scales are two different ways to display price data, and each has distinct uses and advantages depending on the data range and trading objectives.

### 1. **Arithmetic (Linear) Scale**

- **Description**: On an arithmetic scale, the y-axis (price axis) is divided into equal intervals, so each unit represents the same absolute change in price.
- **Appearance**: This scale makes price increases look linear. A move from $10 to $20 appears the same in height as a move from $90 to $100, even though they represent different percentage changes.
- **Use Case**: Best for short-term charts or instruments with narrow price ranges, where absolute price movements are more relevant than percentage changes.

**Example**:

- Moving from $10 to $20 represents a $10 increase, and so does $90 to $100, so they both appear equally spaced on the chart.

### 2. **Logarithmic (Log) Scale**

- **Description**: On a logarithmic scale, the y-axis is spaced based on percentage changes rather than absolute price changes. For example, each unit increase on the axis might represent a doubling or another set percentage increase in price.
- **Appearance**: Price increases appear smaller as the price gets higher. Moving from $10 to $20 will look larger than from $90 to $100, as the percentage change from $10 to $20 (100%) is much larger than from $90 to $100 (11.1%).
- **Use Case**: Ideal for long-term charts, especially when analyzing assets with large price fluctuations over time. Itâ€™s helpful when looking at exponential growth trends, where a logarithmic scale better captures proportional changes in price.

**Example**:

- A move from $10 to $20 (100% increase) would be a significant jump, while from $90 to $100 (about 11% increase) would appear smaller on a log scale.

### Choosing Between Arithmetic and Logarithmic Scales

- **Logarithmic Scale**: Useful for identifying trends in volatile assets or markets with significant price ranges, often preferred in long-term stock charts and high-growth assets.
- **Arithmetic Scale**: Better for short-term trading or in low-volatility environments, where absolute price changes are more actionable.

Using both scales can provide insights, as some technical indicators or trends may be clearer on one scale over the other.

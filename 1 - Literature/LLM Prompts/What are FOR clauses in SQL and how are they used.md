**FOR clauses in SOQL** are optional keywords that modify how Salesforce processes the query under the hood. They are mostly used for optimization or concurrency control. These clauses help with things like **record locking**, **query efficiency**, or **reduced sharing recalculations**.

### **Types of FOR Clauses in SOQL**

1. **`FOR UPDATE`**
2. **`FOR VIEW`**
3. **`FOR REFERENCE`**

---

### **1. `FOR UPDATE` – Locking Records**

- **Purpose**: Locks the returned records so that no other transaction can modify them until your transaction completes.
- **Use Case**: Prevent race conditions in concurrent updates (like in triggers or batch jobs).

**Example:**
```apex
Account acc = [SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE Id = :acctId FOR UPDATE];
```

- This locks the account record until the transaction completes.
- Prevents other updates on the same record from succeeding during that time.

**Important Notes:**
- Locking works only in Apex transactions.
- It doesn’t lock child records.

### **2. `FOR VIEW` – Marking Records as Viewed**

- **Purpose**: Optimizes sharing recalculations by marking records as accessed.
- **Use Case**: When records are accessed and should be included in **“LastViewedDate”**.

**Example:**
```apex
List<Case> cases = [SELECT Subject FROM Case WHERE Status = 'New' FOR VIEW];
```

- Helps Salesforce decide when to recalculate visibility or analytics.
- Doesn’t affect record data or lock anything.

---

### **3. `FOR REFERENCE` – Marking Records as Referenced**

- **Purpose**: Similar to `FOR VIEW`, but records are marked as "referenced" rather than "viewed".
- **Use Case**: Useful for things like **tracking dependencies**, analytics, or optimizing sharing recalculations without updating LastViewedDate.

**Example:**
```apex
List<Opportunity> opps = [SELECT Name FROM Opportunity WHERE Amount > 50000 FOR REFERENCE];
```

### **When to Use Which Clause?**

| Clause        | Locks Records? | Affects LastViewedDate? | Use Case                                 |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `FOR UPDATE`  | Yes            | No                       | Prevent concurrent edits                  |
| `FOR VIEW`    | No             | Yes                      | User views data (e.g., UI or analytics)   |
| `FOR REFERENCE` | No           | No                       | System references data, optimize sharing  |

---

### **Best Practices**

- Use `FOR UPDATE` **sparingly** and only when absolutely needed, as it can lead to deadlocks if not handled carefully.
- Use `FOR VIEW` or `FOR REFERENCE` in **read-heavy** operations (batch jobs, reports) to help Salesforce optimize sharing visibility recalculations.

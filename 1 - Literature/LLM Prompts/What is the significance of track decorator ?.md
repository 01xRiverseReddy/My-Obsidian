In modern **Salesforce Lightning Web Components (LWC)**, **all properties of an object are reactive by default**, which makes the `@track` decorator **largely obsolete for most use cases**.

### Here's the breakdown:

#### ✅ **Current Behavior (LWC today):**
- **Primitive types** (e.g., `string`, `number`, `boolean`) are **automatically reactive**.
- **Objects and arrays** are **also reactive**, but **only when the reference to the object or array changes**.

#### ❌ **What is NOT reactive by default:**
When you **mutate** an object or array **in place**, the component doesn’t automatically re-render. Example:

```javascript
this.myObject.name = 'New Name'; // ❌ Won't trigger re-render
```

This is where the `@track` decorator was originally useful.

### 🟡 Significance of `@track`:
In **earlier versions of LWC**, you needed `@track` to make object or array properties reactive. Example:

```javascript
@track myObject = { name: 'John' };
```

But as of **2020 update**, this is no longer required — you just have to update the **reference**, like:

```javascript
this.myObject = { ...this.myObject, name: 'New Name' }; // ✅ Will trigger re-render
```

### 🔍 When should you use `@track` today?
Rarely. It's mainly:
- For **backward compatibility** with old code.
- When you're on a **very old Salesforce version**.
- To **emphasize** intentional reactivity in complex nested structures (still rare).

### ✅ Modern Best Practice:
Avoid `@track`. Instead, **update object/array references** to trigger reactivity.

Would you like a small example showing the difference with and without changing reference?




Absolutely, let's break it down with a simple example to show **why changing the reference** of an object or array is necessary in LWC for **reactivity**.

### 🔧 Scenario: You want to update a property in an object and reflect it in the UI

#### 🧪 Example 1: **Mutating an object directly (no re-render)**
```js
// JS Controller
myObject = { name: 'John' };

// Later in some method
this.myObject.name = 'Jane';  // ❌ UI will NOT re-render
```

#### 🧪 Example 2: **Changing the reference (triggers re-render)**
```js
// JS Controller
myObject = { name: 'John' };

// Later in some method
this.myObject = { ...this.myObject, name: 'Jane' };  // ✅ UI WILL re-render
```

Here’s a full example with UI included:

### ✅ Full Working Example

#### `exampleComponent.html`
```html
<template>
    <lightning-card title="User Info">
        <p>Name: {myObject.name}</p>
        <lightning-button label="Change Name" onclick={changeName}></lightning-button>
    </lightning-card>
</template>
```

#### `exampleComponent.js`
```js
import { LightningElement } from 'lwc';

export default class ExampleComponent extends LightningElement {
    myObject = { name: 'John' };

    changeName() {
        // Mutating directly won't trigger UI update:
        // this.myObject.name = 'Jane'; ❌ No re-render

        // Correct way: change the reference to trigger reactivity
        this.myObject = { ...this.myObject, name: 'Jane' };  // ✅ UI re-renders
    }
}
```

### ⚠️ Why this works
LWC tracks changes by reference for objects and arrays. So unless you **assign a new object/array**, it doesn’t detect the internal mutation for rendering.

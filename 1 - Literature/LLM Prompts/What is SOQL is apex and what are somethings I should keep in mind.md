SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language) is a Salesforce search language used in Apex to perform **text searches** across multiple objects and fields (both standard and custom). It is different from SOQL, which is used to query one object at a time.

### **What is SOSL?**

- SOSL allows you to search for a **term** (like a keyword or phrase) across **multiple objects and fields** in a single query.
- Useful when you don’t know where the data might reside.
- It returns a list of **lists of sObjects**.

---

### **Basic Syntax Example**

```apex
List<List<SObject>> searchLists = [FIND 'John*' IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Contact(Id, Name), Account(Id, Name)];
```

- `FIND 'John*'`: Searches for terms starting with "John".
- `IN ALL FIELDS`: Searches all searchable text fields.
- `RETURNING Contact, Account`: Specifies objects and fields to return.

### **Things to Keep in Mind While Designing SOSL Queries**

1. **Use Cases:**
   - Ideal for **global search** or when you need to search across **multiple objects or fields**.
   - Not suitable when you're querying based on structured filters or needing relationships (use SOQL for that).

2. **Performance:**
   - **Faster than SOQL** for large text searches.
   - However, avoid using too frequently or with complex wildcards in tight loops.

3. **Indexing:**
   - SOSL searches only on fields that are indexed for search.
   - Not all fields are searchable by default (like formula fields or encrypted fields).

4. **Governance & Limits:**
   - **2000 row limit** per object per SOSL query.
   - Counts as one query against the **governor limits** (like SOQL).
   - Avoid chaining multiple SOSL queries – try to batch them.

5. **Wildcard Usage:**
   - Wildcards like `*` or `?` can help, but can also hurt performance.
   - Use them **sparingly**, especially at the beginning of a search term.

6. **Null Values:**
   - SOSL does **not return** records with `null` in the searched fields.

7. **Escape Characters:**
   - Be careful when searching for special characters. You may need to escape them properly.

8. **Security:**
   - SOSL respects the user's **field-level** and **object-level** security.
   - Make sure to design queries keeping access controls in mind.

9. **Result Handling:**
   - It returns a `List<List<SObject>>` — each inner list corresponds to one object type.
   - You need to explicitly cast or loop through each type to handle them properly.

   ```apex
   for (SObject s : searchLists[0]) {
       Contact c = (Contact)s;
       System.debug(c.Name);
   }
   ```

### **When to Use SOSL vs SOQL?**

| Use Case                             | Use SOSL | Use SOQL |
|--------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| Need to search across multiple objects | Yes      | No       |
| Know the object and want related data | No       | Yes      |
| Text search or keyword-based search   | Yes      | No       |
| Structured data query with filters    | No       | Yes      |

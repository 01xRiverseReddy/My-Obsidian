1. Fair Value Zone
	1. Fair Value Zone is the area equilibrium spot on the trading chart. This is the area that has the most amount of trading volume where buyers and sellers constantly facilitate trading . During this process , financial institutions , investment bankers etc are the big player that have the money to disrupt the equilibrium of the markets .
	2. The main goal is to monitor the movements of these big players and mimic their actions to attain profitability . 
	3. The key difference between us and the big player is that they are long term players and we are short term , which means that they operate on a much higher time frame like , daily , weekly , monthly whereas the we trade on 5min,15min, 1h,4h. 
2. lower and upper boundary
	1. The upper and lower boundary refer to the area which confine the fair value .
	2. These levels usually act as support and resistance levels on the chart in the value . 
3. Excess
	1. Excess price is the price when a security moves outside of the fair value zone . 
	2. Excess price is an indication on potential players stepping in .
	3. Excess price is short lived and are usually a few candles . 
	4. When the excess price is just one candle protruding out of the value area and moving back in , it is referred to as a **Tail** .
4. Trading Volume 
	1. It is the total number of shares , contracts , futures , positions traded . 
	2. The trading volume of the big players is the highest on pops up clearly on the market . 
	3. Trading volume by price of a security is the most at the fair value and relatively less in the excess regions . 
5. Control Price 
	1. Control Price is the area within the value area that influences the price to oscillate within the upper and the lower boundary . 
	2. Control Price is a crucial value in taking trade calls . 
	3. A Value are always has control price , if it is not visible , it would be a better option to lower down the time frame and observe the perfect lines  . 
6. Initiative and Responsive Trading
	1. Initiative trading is the behavior that is observed by the big player . 
	2. When the big player observes that the price at which the security is trading is no longer a profitable level or vice versa , he makes an action that would move the price of the security in a direction which usually out of the value area . 
	3. Responsive trading the counterpart of initiative trading , when an initiative move happens , responsive trading **MAY OR MAY NOT** happen . 
	4. Responsive trading may be a little low in volume compared to the initiative trading . It usually tends to push the price back into the value area . 
7. Value Shifting
	1. Value shifting is mutated version of fair value where , in some scenarios the demand or supply might slightly be imbalanced . 
	2. In such scenarios the price usually shifts slowly to one direction forming uptrend or a downtrend . 
	3. Even in such circumstances , there exists a control price that governs this movement . 
8. value high , value low , excess
	1. When in an uptrend or downtrend the price of a security might tend be inclined on one side of the control price causing zero trading activity on the other . This indicates a clear change in momentum of the dynamic that is in place . 
	2. When there is multiple excess prices on one side of the boundary it means that , the dynamic that preventing the breakout is in power . 
	3. 
9. Pinbar - Rejection Strategy 
	1. A pinbar is a candlestick that moves away from the value area and live a very short life in the price range . It could be on either of the upper or lower boundaries . 
	2. The Pinbar Rejection strategy basically emphasises on the fact that . A security has not stabilised in a price range for any amount of time therefore , the price range it has reached has undergone a <b> REJECTION</b>  , therefore it is an opportunity to enter trade where the price in future could hit either of the boundaries in a value area. 
	3. An other plus point about this strategy is that some breakouts might result in fakouts, but rejections are a stronger influence in the market is it breeds on the emotion of the retail trader . 
10.  Framework 
	1. Never jump in to short time frames following blind steps .
	2. Always get the big picture in sight and then make calls accordingly in lower timeframes.
	3.  Confluence [[what does confluence mean in price action trading]] . It is basically getting multiple metrics in line before making a calculated decision . 
11. Trend Identification and change 
	1. Higher highs + Higher lows = uptrend
	2. Lower Highs + lower Lows = downtrend
	3. In a downtrend, when price rotations become small and they happen in the upper part of the value area, the trend is most likely to end. The narrower the rotations, the bigger the break of value will be. vice vera.
	4. The further price moves down, away from value area low, in excess territory, the bigger the possibility that the current value or trend will be broken.

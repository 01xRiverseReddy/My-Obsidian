### Brute Force 
No brute force approach for this in mind . 


### Optimal Approach 
- For water to be entrapped between two columns , we need to have two towers of some height and the height of the smaller tower will batter because it is the upper limit of storage . 
- Start from the left , starting of the array , and keep track of two variables `mx` to keep track of the max height of the column `mxi` to store the index of the max .
- As we iterate over the array , when we hit a smaller height , we add `mx- arr[i]` to sum variable . 
- When we hit a new max we add the sum to the answer `ans+=sum` , because that is the total collection of rainwater between the two heights . 
- There is a corner case , if the max height is not at the last index of the array , we can never add the water entrapped for the last pair to the answer . 
- We reinitialise `sum = 0 and mx= 0 ` , and then we reiterate from last index of the array till `mxi` .
- We repeat the process , if we find a new max we update `mx` and `ans+=sum` or else we add `ans+= mx-arr[i]`
- We return the `ans`

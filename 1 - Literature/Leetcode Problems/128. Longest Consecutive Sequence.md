Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.


Idea - 
Sorting it would straight away give the solution but the challenge is to do in `O(n)` . What we can do is not achieve it strictly in `O(n)` but we can try to achieve it  below `O(nlogn)` . The idea is that we don't need to iterate over each possible sequence . We only need to iterate from the first number of the sequence as it would anyways be the maximum answer . 

Approach - 

1. Store a `unordered_map<int,bool> ` hashmap of the occurrence of each number . 
2. Iterate over each element in the `nums` . 
3. Check if each number is the first occurence in `nums` `hmap[i-1]==true` . 
4. if the condition satisfying , iterate from i until `hmap[i+j]!=true`
5. After each iteration store the max of the answer and `j`. 


Time Complexity- `O(nk)` where k is the average length of a sequence . 
Space Complexity - `O(n)`

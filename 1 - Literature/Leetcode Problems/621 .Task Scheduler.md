The solution towards their problem can branch into two ways .One is the greedy way which is in linear time but the one which I use is the `O (N LogN) `  . The idea is to compute other tasks while we wait for the time constraint to be lifted . We do this by using priority queue and queue conjunctively . 

We take a taskâ€™s frequency add it to the priority queue . We pop the top element of the priority queue , we consider that task computed and then we store the moment of time on when this task would free up along with the reduced frequency . If we have the frequency 3 at time 0 with a gap of 2 , which is the first task , we cut the frequency down by on 1 and store the free up time < 2,2>  and add it to the queue. When we reach time 2 , we check the front of queue , if time equals two we pop the the top and add it to the priority queue . 

We repeat this process until both priority queue and q are empty and then we return time .

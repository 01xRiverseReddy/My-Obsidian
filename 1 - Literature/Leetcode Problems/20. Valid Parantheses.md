#### Problem Statement 
Given a string of only `{,},[,],(,)` characters , return a boolean value on whether the string is a valid string or not . 


#### Brute Force 
The brute force approach would be to find the corresponding pair for every bracket through an iteration . This is expensive and this can be done directly through a single iteration by keeping track of the last variable using stack . 


#### Optimal Approach 

- Initialise a stack to keep of opening parentheses .
- Iterate over the string and whenever come across an opening parentheses , we add it to the stack . 
- If we ever come across a closing parenthesis we check the top variable of the stack . 
- If the stack is empty we return false straight way , else we check the closing parentheses corresponds to the opening parentheses . 
- If they do then we move on , else we straight away return false . 
- The default case would be true . Hence if the iteration runs without hiccups then the string is valid .

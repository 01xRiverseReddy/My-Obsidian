#### Problem Statement 
Given a list of strings either a number or a numeric operation `+,-,*,\` . Evaluate the list in the form of reverse polish notation and return the result integer . 


#### Brute Force
There is no brute force approach . The optimal approach is the only way since the array is already in a reverse polish notation format . 


#### Optimal Approach 

- Optimal Approach is to keep a stack of integers. Since the reverse polish notation comes in the format of `num, num , operand` 
- We iterate over the array , for loop and not while loop . 
- Whenever we encounter a number we check and push it to the stack . 
- If we encounter an operand , we pause and pop the top the top two elements of the stack . 
- Based on the operand we encounter we perform the action on those two numbers and then equate it to `ans` . 
- Since the array is valid and there is always an answer , we push the ans to the stack and wait for the next operand . 
- After the loop ends , we return `ans` .

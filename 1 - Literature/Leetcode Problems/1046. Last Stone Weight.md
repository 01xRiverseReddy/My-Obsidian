### Solution 

We just maintain a priority queue and always get the top two stones . If they are equal we ignore and pop, else we add the diff to the priority queue after popping these two elements . We return whatever is there on top of the priority . We always have a condition that the procedure runs only when the size of the pq is greater than 1.

**Problem Statement**
Give an array of strings , group all the strings that are anagrams and return it in `vector<vector<string>>`

**Brute Force

We could blindly do an iteration over the array for each string to find anagrams . This approach would take `O(n^2(k))` .  where k is the size of the string . The key time consuming operation in the above approach is repeating an iteration for every string . If we could cache the signature of an anagram we do not have to repeat iterations . 


**Optimal Approach

- Create a hashmap `<string,vector<string>>`  to store the anagram signature and the string in the value 
- Loop over the array 
- At each iteration sort the string to get the signature of anagram and use it as key to push the string back in the hashmap . `hmap[sorted(s)].puhs_back(s)`
- Return the value set of the hashmap.

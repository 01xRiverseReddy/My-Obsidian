### Solution 

The easy and straightforward solution is to use extra space maintain a hashmap of type `<int*,bool>`  and store each addresses and consider each one visited . 
There is a slower but more memory efficient way to achieve this and this is through fast and slow pointers . We take two points and after each iteration the slow pointer will move by just one node , while the fast pointer will move by two nodes . This way if a cycle exists , then at some point , the slow and the fast pointer will be at the same position .

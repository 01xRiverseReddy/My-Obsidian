#### Problem Statement 
Give an array where each index represents a vertical line . Return the area of maximum amount of water that can be stored between two indices .

#### Brute force 
The brute force approach would be to use two loops and find two such indices where the area occupied by the water between them would be maximum . This would take `O(n^2)` iterations and this could be done within`O(n)`

#### Optimal Approach 
- We can use two pointers approach with two variables `i=0 and j=arr.size()-1` 
- At each iteration we calculate the max area that water can occupy by using `(j-i)*max(arr[j],arr[i])`
- How do we move from each iteration . If `i<j` there is no point in decrementing `j` since `j-i` while decrease regardless , and by decrementing `j` we will definitely get an area that is smaller because  `max(arr[i],arr[j])` will decrease  . Hence we increment `i` by 1. 
- If it is the other way round , we decrement `j` by 1. 
- This way at some point we will find the optimal answer .

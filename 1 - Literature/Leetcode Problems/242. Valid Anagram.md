Given two string find out if they are an anagram . `b` is an anagram of `a` if it can be formed by rearranging the alphabets . 


**Brute Force :**
Brute force approach in my opinion would be to sort both strings and check if they are the same . This would take `nlog(n)` .

**Optimal Approach :**

- Check if the size of the strings match . If they don't , then they are obviously not anagrams. 
- Try to minimise the number of operations . 
- Create an array `map` of int type and of 27 size to keep track of each lowercase alphabet . 
- Iterate over the first string and increment the map for each char. 
- Iterate over the second string and decrement the map for each char . 
- Iterate over the map and if any index is not zero then the strings are not anagrams because they are either falling short of chars or have more than what they need .

**Problem Statement**
Given an array return an array where each element is the result of the product of the remaining elements . Ex `[1,2,3,4]` = `[24,12,8,6]`


**brute force**
The brute force approach is straight forward . Just loop over again for each element to find the product . This is time consuming as it is `O(n^2)` and can be easily optimised to `O(n)` . 

**Optimised Approach**
- We can iterate over the array once and get the product of all the numbers . 
- In the second iteration we replace each element with `prod/nums[i]`
- This would straight away give the answer but there are a couple of corner cases . 
- When there is one zero in the entire array we have to skip it while calculating the prod. Since the result array will only have zero populated and the others equal to zero . 
- If there are two zeroes the entire result will be zero anyways because the product of the remaining numbers will be zero no matter what .

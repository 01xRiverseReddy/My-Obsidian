**Problem statement :**
Given an array and an integer . Check if any two distinct numbers add up to the given integer . 


**Brute Force** 
Brute force approach would be to check every possible combination and this would be `O(n^2)` . We can sort the array and use a two pointer approach and this would take `O(nlogn)`

**Optimal Approach 
- Since two have to find any two indices . We could potentially cache a value incase we find a perfect pair . 
- create a map of `<int,int>` 
- Iterate over the array and check if the `target - arr[i]` exists in the map . If it does , then we have an answer . 
- If the number doesn't exist simply update them map with `hmap[arr[i]]=1;
-

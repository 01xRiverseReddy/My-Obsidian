Selection Sort is a sorting algorithm with average case time complexity as O(n^2) . On every iteration it take the first number as minimum and iterates through the rest of the array to find the minimum . 
When the minimum is found it swaps the two indices therefore we are left with two states , left sorted state and right sorted state .

This video is by Arpit Bharani and discusses how indexes work . 
The video initially goes on about explaining databases work in a simplistic perspective on how they store data / records in blocks and how a standard disk i/o would look . 
He then explains that an index in the simplest form is another table with two columns that stores the key ( which is a columns ) and the block value to search .

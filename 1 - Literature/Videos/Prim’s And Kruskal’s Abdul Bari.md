This video just show the algorithm involved in Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithm to find minimum spanning tree . Minimum Spanning Tree is a tree derived from a CONNECTED WEIGHTED GRAPH . 
The thing is you need to know how to find a cycle in a graph using disjoint set union to perform Kruskal’s algorithm .

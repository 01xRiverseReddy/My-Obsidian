In this video the author talks about the four squares c3-f3 and c6-f6 which are the centre squares . The goal is to have certain pieces positioned in the centre such that we can get absolute control over the key square from those positions . 


The night for instance can cover 52 squares with a two move combination by positioning herself in the centre four squares . 

Sometimes the centre is not everything , for instance , even if the player has control over the centre he might have left multiple weak points on other areas of the board . There is no point of in having control over these squares if our opponent can target areas and snatch the game from us .

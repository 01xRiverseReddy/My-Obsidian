Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm with O(n^2) complexity . 
The basic idea of insertion sort is to use two states of the array such that after each iteration one state of the array is sorted . The two states are the left side and right side of the array . After each iteration the left side of the array is sorted by comparing the first the first element on the right most side .

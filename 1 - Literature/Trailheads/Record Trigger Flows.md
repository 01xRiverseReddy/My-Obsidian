#### Get Started with Triggered Flows

- Different types of flows which are screen flows , autolaunched flows and triggered flows . 
- Different types of triggered flows such as record-triggered , scheduled flow , platform event . 
- Record triggered flows can be used for the following scenarios , Fast Field Updates , Related Record Actions , Run Asynchronously and scheduled paths . 

#### Build a Record-Triggered Flow 

-  A record triggered flow can be built using  the ‘new flow’ button on setup . 
- You can specify the start conditions for the flow so that you can optimally trigger the firing of the flow .


#### Add a scheduled Task to Your Flow 

- You can add a scheduled path to the flow by clicking ‘play icon’ . 
- What scheduled path basically does that we can choose to have a certain set of tasks be performed later . 

#### Meet Flow Trigger Explorer
- It is hard for use to find all the trigger flows that have been built on a specific object hence we have a button on the new flow page that lets us see all the record-trigger flows on an object .

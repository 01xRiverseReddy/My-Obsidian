#### Choose the Right Search Solution 

- The two main search solutions salesforce users can use are SOQL and SOSL . 
- SOQL is to get specific records of a specific object . 
- SOSL is more a searching mechanism to get records from multiple objects through keyword matching . 
- Salesforce also offers to extend global search to get records that are not within salesforce by using what is called as Salesforce Federated Search . 


#### Build Search for Common Use Cases 

- We can use SOSL to build a search solution for customers usually when they are trying to find shoes or any products in general . 


#### Optimise search results 

- We can perform custom optimisations to the SOQL query such a confining the search space , reducing the fields to return etc

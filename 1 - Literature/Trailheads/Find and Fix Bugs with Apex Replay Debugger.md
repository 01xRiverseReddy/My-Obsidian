#SFDCDev #unmerged 

- First unit is just the introduction to apex replay debugger and just shows the functionalities it has to offer such as breakpoints , viewing variable values at different instances . Apex interactive debugger and ISV are paid tools i guess to debug apex code . Apex replay debugger comes as an extension .
- Unit two is just installation 
- Third unit is just setting apex replay debugger 
- The fourth Unit introduces to Breakpoints and Checkpoints . Breakpoints basically pause execution and available to be set in VS code and favours variable inspection . Checkpoint is a special type of breakpoint that favour complex data structures and can be setup in dev console (up to 5 ) . Checkpoint doesnâ€™t stop the flow of the code it just creates a snaptshot of the object and captures heap data .

• Description: A list of all edges, where each edge is represented as a tuple (u, v) or (u, v, weight).

• Space Complexity: O(E).

• Advantages:

• Very compact representation.

• Useful for algorithms like Kruskal’s (minimum spanning tree).

• Disadvantages:

• Inefficient for finding neighbors or checking if an edge exists.

• Example:

  

`Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)]

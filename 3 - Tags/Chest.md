The chest is primarily made up of the **pectoralis major** and **pectoralis minor** muscles, which can be divided into upper, middle, and lower regions based on the orientation of the muscle fibers. Understanding these regions can help in targeting specific areas during workouts for balanced development.

### 1. Upper Chest

- **Anatomy**: The upper chest primarily refers to the **clavicular head** of the pectoralis major muscle.
- **Location**: This region is situated near the collarbone (clavicle) and extends towards the shoulder.
- **Muscle Fiber Orientation**: The fibers of the upper chest run at an angle from the clavicle down to the sternum.
- **Functions**:
    - Responsible for shoulder flexion (lifting the arm forward).
    - Plays a role in shoulder adduction (bringing the arm toward the body).
    - Important for movements such as incline presses and overhead lifts.
- **Exercises to Target**:
    - [[Inclined Dumbbell Press]]

### 2. Middle Chest

- **Anatomy**: The middle chest primarily involves the **sternocostal head** of the pectoralis major.
- **Location**: This region spans across the sternum and the ribs, making it the broadest part of the chest.
- **Muscle Fiber Orientation**: The fibers run horizontally from the sternum towards the humerus (upper arm bone).
- **Functions**:
    - Crucial for horizontal adduction (bringing the arm across the body).
    - Engaged in pressing movements that involve pushing the arms away from the body.
- **Exercises to Target**:
    - [[Dumbbell Press]]
    - [[Dumbbell Flys]]

### 3. Lower Chest

- **Anatomy**: The lower chest also involves the **sternocostal head** of the pectoralis major, particularly the lower fibers.
- **Location**: This region is located below the middle chest, nearer to the abdomen.
- **Muscle Fiber Orientation**: The fibers run diagonally upwards from the lower ribs towards the humerus.
- **Functions**:
    - Important for shoulder extension (moving the arm backward).
    - Engaged in pressing movements that target the lower portion of the chest.
- **Exercises to Target**:
    - [[Free Stand Cable Pull]]

### Summary of the Regions

- **Upper Chest**: Engaged during incline movements and responsible for lifting the arm upward.
- **Middle Chest**: The main area for horizontal pushing movements, providing the bulk and width of the chest.
- **Lower Chest**: Focused on decline movements and responsible for extending the arm backward and downward.

By understanding these regions, you can tailor your workout routine to ensure balanced chest development, emphasizing exercises that target each area effectively. This can help improve aesthetics, strength, and overall functional movement.

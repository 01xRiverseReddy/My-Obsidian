The **triceps brachii** is a three-headed muscle located on the back of the upper arm, and it plays a crucial role in extending the elbow. The three heads of the triceps are the **long head**, **lateral head**, and **medial head**. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the long head and lateral head of the triceps:

### 1. Long Head of the Triceps

- **Anatomy**:
    
    - **Origin**: The long head originates from the **infraglenoid tubercle** of the scapula (shoulder blade).
    - **Insertion**: It inserts into the **olecranon process** of the ulna (the bony prominence of the elbow).
- **Function**:
    
    - The long head primarily acts to extend the elbow joint, but it also contributes to shoulder extension and adduction since it crosses the shoulder joint.
    - It plays a role in stabilizing the shoulder and can be engaged in movements that involve raising the arms overhead.
- **Training Emphasis**:
    
    - The long head is activated during various upper body exercises, especially those that involve overhead movements or those that place the arm in a position above the shoulder.
    - Exercises that specifically target the long head include:
        - Overhead triceps extensions (with dumbbells or cables)
        - Close-grip bench press
        - Skull crushers (with a focus on arm position)

### 2. Lateral Head of the Triceps

- **Anatomy**:
    
    - **Origin**: The lateral head originates from the **posterior surface** of the humerus (the upper arm bone) above the radial groove.
    - **Insertion**: Like the long head, it inserts into the olecranon process of the ulna.
- **Function**:
    
    - The lateral head primarily functions to extend the elbow joint. It is particularly active during high-force extension movements.
    - It contributes to the overall bulk and shape of the triceps, giving it a wider appearance.
- **Training Emphasis**:
    
    - The lateral head is effectively targeted during pressing movements and is most engaged in exercises that involve extending the elbow without significant shoulder involvement.
    - Exercises that target the lateral head include:
        - [[Rope Pushdown]]
    

### Summary of Differences

- **Long Head**:
    
    - **Origin**: Infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula.
    - **Function**: Extends the elbow, aids in shoulder extension and adduction.
    - **Targeting Exercises**: Overhead triceps extensions, close-grip bench press.
- **Lateral Head**:
    
    - **Origin**: Posterior surface of the humerus above the radial groove.
    - **Function**: Primarily extends the elbow, contributing to the muscle's shape.
    - **Targeting Exercises**: Triceps pushdowns, dips.

### Importance in Training

To develop well-rounded triceps strength and aesthetics, it's essential to incorporate exercises that target all three heads of the triceps (including the medial head, which is located deep and less visible). Balancing your training can help prevent muscle imbalances and promote overall upper arm strength.

#### Surfer's Physique 
- The ideal surfer would be lean in shape with small chest as it the least exercised during a surf session . 
- The shoulder blades are most visible and important muscle group as they entirely responsible for the frequency of the paddling motion . 
- The next noticeable muscle groups are biceps , triceps and forearms . These muscles correspond to the speed of the paddling motion . The paddling motion requires the rowing motion which is done by the other part of the arms . 
- Legs muscle groups come before the Back muscles (even when back is more important )  because the size of leg muscles are more noticeable in size . Back muscles even after rigorous exercise remain unnoticed unless they are flexed . 
- The reason I say legs and not any particular muscle group in those legs because all of they play a pivotal role in Pop-up and balance . Calves and Quadriceps are the most observable muscle groups whereas Glutes and hamstrings are on the back to the observable person hence are less visible . 
- Finally the back muscles , the least visible yet play a role in maintaining the cobra position and a little boost to the paddling power . Mainly and mostly , the upper back muscles are the muscles that only matter in surfing . The lower back is not much in the picture . 



### Paddling
- The Paddling motion completely exercises the arms . The entire arm , shoulders biceps triceps forearms , is put into motion . 
- ##### Shoulders 
  - To exercise all three shoulder blades we can resort to both calisthenic and strength training .

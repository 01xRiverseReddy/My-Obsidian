1. **Introduction** -
	 Key thing I learnt from this chapter is that "Market discounts Everything . The idea behind this phrase is that any activity , let it be the news , economy , foreign investor etc , these factors are bound to reflect in the market . 
	 
	 There are two types of traders , technical and fundamental . Technical traders are those traders who look at the charts , use technical indicators and make buy or sell calls . Fundamental traders are those who do not look at the chart at all , they mainly focus on the kind of business an underlying stock is into , the economy , the adjacent stocks in the sector . 

	 Usually leaning towards either one side of these two methodologies is risky , the reason being that is the technical trader has an awareness of the current trend of the stock , while the fundamental trader has an overview of the economy or the factors affecting the business the stock is representing . Not having the knowledge of either of these will results in an increase in the margin of error . 

 2. **Dow Theory** - 
	 Dow is a person of the late 1880s who formulated his theories on stock market prices (indirectly) . His successors published his methods , which would elaborate that the market primarily has three phases - Primary , Intermediate , minor . 

	 Primary phase is basically bull or bear run , this phase lasts for months or even years . This usually has 3 phases , accumulation phase where big investors step in and put their money .  Participation phase where retail investors and traders follow the trend . Distribution phase where everyone starts to notice the price yields and cash in profit . 

	 Intermediate phase is a correction phase where the price that has rallied either way and stays stable for a while , lasting for around 4 or 5 months . 

	  Minor phase is usually a fluctuation phase . I didn't understand this much . It usually last less than 3 weeks according to dow . 

3. **Chart Construction** - 

	When it comes to candlestick chart patterns , you can organise them either in an arithmetic structure or a logarithmic structure . [[What is logarithmic scale and arithmetic scale in trading charts]].

	Arithmetic scale is a linear scale which means that on a broad perspective , the rise or fall in changes appear to be of the same height i.e, 10-20 change would be the same as 90-10 . The observation being that 10-20 is a 100% change where as 90-10 is 11.2% change . This charting methodology is better for short time frames like 15m , 1h.

	Logarithmic scale is not a linear scale . The change from 90-100 would be smaller compared to 10-20 . This charting methodology is used on higher time frames like 1D for long term decision making . 

	Open interest is kind of a technical indicator that gives you a metric of all open futures positions . This can be used for decision making but the catch being that this is a lagging indicator and the results are a day late . 

4. Trends -
5. Reversal Patterns -

     There are a few ground rules before considering a rejection . The first being that for a reversal to reverse something , there has to be a trend .Breaking of the trend line is a small indication but not the confirmation .  The second being is that volume has to accompany the move that it taking place . The topping patterns tend to last short whereas the bottom patterns have a bigger scope .

		The Head and shoulders pattern is something that I am already familiar with . The neckline is key . Sometimes it may be a little shifted to one angle but not too shifted to one side . The volume pattern is strong indicator in this pattern . The left shoulder the head and right shoulders's peaks would have diminishing volumes respectively and when the neckline is broken **there may or may not be a pullback move** before moving to the downside . 


- Volume and open interest can be used side by side . They indicate whether the trend is in continuation or the trend might shift momentum . In an uptrend if both volume and open interest are increasing , then it means that the trend is still strong . In an uptrend if the volume and open interest tend to flatten , then it means that the trend might near its term . 

- Futures contracts are a zero sum game . When you open a futures contract of a long , let's say 10x  , it implies that someone has initiated a short position of 10x for you to borrow that sum . 
- Futures contracts basically say that , if the price of bitcoin is trading at $45000 , you would buy a futures contract of %60000 that expires in 6 months. At the time of the expiration , whatever the price of the asset your contract will be liquidate making you suffer both the loss and the profit . You are not obligated to sell the contract at expiry , you can exit when you see an optimal profit . [[How do buying and selling of futures contracts work]]

- On Balance Volume  , it is a type volume momentum indicator . It works on a pretty simple mechanism . If the closing price of the asset is greater than the previous candle's closing price , then the volume is added to the OBV , else it is deducted . If the closing prices are same then the OBV remains same . John J Murphy , suggests to use OBV for continuation and reversals. If the asset price is increasing and and OBV is increasing then the uptrend is doing good . If the asset price is increasing and the OBV is decreasing then it is an indication of reversal . The POTENTIAL problem with this is that it seems stupid . If the price is increasing then the OBV will obviously increase . 

- Open interest is the total number of open futures contracts at the end of the day . This means there will be a one day lag in the reporting of open interest . How open interest is represented , When both the buyer and a seller (long and short) position is entered ( 1 open position is created ) , open interest increases , if both buyer and seller liquidate , the position is closed therefore open interest decreases . If both buyer enters through the liquidation of seller , then there will be no change . [[How is open interest represented]]

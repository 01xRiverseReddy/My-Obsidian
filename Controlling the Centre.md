No matter the colour of the pieces , grabbing centre is a key way to advance to better positions . As white focus more on trying to gain power over the centre . If the opponent moves any piece unnecessarily try to advance a pawn or force the opponent into making retroactive moves that what you can focus more on centre control.

If the opponents has an underdeveloped position use it agains them by developing your pieces and controlling the centre or making them waste moves on undveloping the pieces .

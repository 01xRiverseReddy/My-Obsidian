The deltoid is a large, triangular muscle that covers the shoulder joint, giving it its rounded contour. This muscle plays a key role in shoulder movement and stability, and it has three distinct parts, or "heads," each with specific functions:

### 1. **Anterior Deltoid (Front Head)**

- **Location**: Located at the front of the shoulder.
- **Function**: Primarily responsible for shoulder flexion (lifting the arm forward) and medial (internal) rotation of the shoulder. It also helps with horizontal adduction (moving the arm across the body).
- **Exercises that Target**: 
	- [[Front Raises]]
### 2. **Lateral Deltoid (Middle Head)**

- **Location**: Positioned on the side of the shoulder.
- **Function**: Primarily responsible for shoulder abduction (lifting the arm out to the side). This head gives the shoulder its width and is key for building a broader shoulder appearance.
- **Exercises that Target**: 
	- [[Lateral Raises (Cable)]]
### 3. **Posterior Deltoid (Rear Head)**

- **Location**: Situated at the back of the shoulder.
- **Function**: Responsible for shoulder extension (moving the arm backward), external rotation, and horizontal abduction (moving the arm out to the side and back).
- **Exercises that Target**: Rear delt flyes, reverse pec deck, and bent-over lateral raises.

### How the Three Deltoid Heads Work Together

Each head of the deltoid has its primary role, but they also work together to stabilize the shoulder during various movements. For instance:

- During a shoulder press, all three heads contribute to the movement.
- During compound movements (like bench presses or rows), the deltoids assist the larger chest or back muscles.

Strengthening all three heads of the deltoid is crucial for balanced shoulder development, stability, and injury prevention.

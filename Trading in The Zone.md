### Chapter 1
#### The road to success : Fundamental , technical or mental analysis 

- The author explains in this chapter that in the initial stages of the stock market , everybody relied on fundamental analysis . 
- The problem is that there is [[Reality Gap]] , which means that the gap between prediction and outcome is too high .  Things like timing , psychology , random movements tend to disrupt trading behaviour . 
- Traders then eventually moved on to technical analysis , which was more rewarding in the short term than fundamental analysis but traders kind of need to be accustomed to mental analysis for technical analysis for it to work . 
- Mental analysis , according to Mark Douglass , is the key for a trader make himself placed among 0.1% of the market players . 
- Author emphasises that considering too many variables within the market is loosing game , he kind of suggest to use as minimal as possible but I would disagree . There should be a boundary set for a person by himself . 
- ##### Accepting Risk
  The author emphasises that every trader acknowledges risk when taking a trade , but never accepts or embraces the fact . When fear and uncertainty creep into the mind , all sorts of wrong decisions such early exist , late entries , trailing stops being hit happen .  To make profits , fear , doubt and uncertainty need to be taken out of the equation . 


### Chapter 2 
#### The Lure ( And the Dangers ) of Trading

- ##### Attraction 
  The author says that the most natural tendency of a human being , is to be free an express his freedom .
- When a human expresses his freedom to the fullest extent , without any boundaries or rail guards would experience consistent failure , which is why successful traders have a mental construct .
- Creating a mental construct for a person constantly varies as people come from different social , psychological backgrounds .
- ##### Dangers
  The author emphasises that at every decision a person makes there is a potential that it is a result from a previous "conflict" . What the author means by this is Let's say a child is denied attention throughout his childhood , during the adulthood as opportunity strikes , the child would try to seek attention at most times . 
- Not getting what a human being wants creates a personal vacuum in the mind . We mentally always feel pain when that vacuum is not filled . 
- ##### Unwillingness to Create Rules
  Traders who do not follow a certain standard of discipline are bound to failure , as when it comes to the market , the possibilities are absolutely limitless and with free will , the market will eat you alive . 
- ##### Failure to Take Responsibility
  There would always be a temptation to let go the losses and focus back but the lack of retracing the failure is nothing other than ignorance . 
- ##### Addiction to Random Rewards 
  When you start to accept random rewards from the market , luck comes into the equation of trading and the element of gambling takes over .
  This creates a feedback loop reinforcing inconsistencies dragging down a path to failure . [[Accepting Random Reward and External vs Internal Control]] 
- ##### External vs Internal Control 
  External Control is when we let friends , other traders , sociological factors get into the game and we eventually give up the control vested within us 
  Internal control is when we take full ownership of our own decisions , and stick to our own mental structure .

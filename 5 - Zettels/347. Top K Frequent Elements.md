1.Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the_ `k` _most frequent elements_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

Idea : 
To get the top k frequent elements we can just sort and iterate backwards or even better use a heap and set but the interviewer would strictly demand that we do not use sorting or such data structures . 
What we could also do it just store the count of each element and iterate backwards , this would work if we `nums[i]<10^6` but assuming for the worst we have to do better . 
What we could do is store each element in a count array where each index `i` would be the frequency of any number and the array `arr[i]` would contain a numbers from `nums` with that particular frequency . This would always be less than `nums.size()` . 

Approach :
1. Since the challenge is to achieve it with a time complexity less than `O (n log n )`  , we have to achieve it in `O(n)`. The hint is to use something like [[Bucket Sort]]
2. First we store the frequency of each element in a hash map `unordered_map<int,int>` .
3. We then create a new  `bucket vector<vector<int>>` of size `nums.size().
4. We iterate over the hash map and then update `bucket` with numbers being added to the respective count indices .
5. Finally we iterate backwards on `bucket` k times to get the most frequently occurring elements .
